#### introduction
This is a real-time detection system which can diaplay heart rate waveform 
and  calculate HRV  through the Internet.

There are total nine files in the archive file. Firstly, ECG.exe is the main file. 
The system starts to operate after clicking it. And picture splash is displayed
when loading the ECG.exe. File mylog fucntions as output, showing the 
result especially some relevant mistake. While three groups of ECG data, 
serving as input, are stored in File RecData, two pictures showing the status 
of serial port are saved in File Res. 

When the system is working, click the button 'start sampling' in order to open 
the serial port and receive the signals. Four graphs showing the waveforms of 
these signals in frequency domain and time domain are diaplayed on the left 
of the website. The ration and position of the graphs as well as the filters and 
its parameter uesd in the sampling procedure can be changed by clicking the 
popup menu on its right. Meanwhile, the calculated HRV was shown.
